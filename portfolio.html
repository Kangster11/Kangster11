    <p1> This is our 1.1.9 project. We made an eggdog which is essential just a picture of a dog that been edited into the shape of an egg.
    <p1> We used a beach wallpaer as our background to make eggdog stand out more on the screen.
    <p1> We first coded so there's an eggdog in the middle serving the purpose of spanwing another eggdog that is controllable.
    <p1> We maded so it can move left or right on command using the left and right arrow button on the keyboard.</p1>

    <p1> We designed a game that is similar to the snake game. We replace the replace with a baby duck and replaced apple with variaty of foods. 
    <p1> The goal is to get as many food as possible while not colliding with the wall and the ducks behind it. However, if you do hit the wall 
    <p1> or the ducks behind it the game will reset and the duck will be centered back to the middle of the screen.The backgrounds are all 
    <p1> randowmized and so is the different types of food.

    <p1> This project is called Animal Clicker. It is a points gathering game where the more points the better. You start off by clicking the
    <p1> chick to store points into the scoreboard, when you've gathered enough points the elephant icon will become solid then you can start
    <p1> clicking on the elephant which auto generates one point/sec and the same goes for the puppy, only it generates 2 points/sec.

    <p1> We thought that the data was from the rocky mountains. This is because the temperature starts off relatively cool and heats up quickly 
    <p1> and stays warm. This pattern follows the same pattern of the rocky mountains. The light intensity is very high, but is disrupted 
    <p1> frequently, which leads us to believe that maybe clouds were causing the intensity of light to decrease every once in a while. 
    <p1> The other regions did not have this feature. The sound was relatively quiet, ranging from =20 to 10 units, so we assumed that there
    <p1> was some sort of low and constant type of sound going on. Lastly, the pressure seemed pretty constant with slight variation, so we
    <p1> believed that the wind would have slight variation but to be constant.

    <p1> Project 3.2.4 Project Honey as an Indicator

    <br> 
    <p1> The project is about a collected information on bee colony decline. Our goal is to study and extracted information from a large group 
    <p1> of data to see if the effect of bee colony health on honey growth. The first bar graph shows the decrease of honey production over the 
    <p1> year and the second bar graph shows the numbers of facilities that processes honey in the United States over the year. As a result, the 
    <p1> increase in bee colony made the honey production more consistant.

    <p1> In this project we explored two comeplex systems. The two images above are two different simulations that we came up with. The simulation
    <p1> is called 3D Solids and it randomly form solid shapes from particles within simulation. In our case the shape was a circle and a rectangle.
    <p1> After that, we compared our simulation with another group of our findings and present it to them.
