    <p1> This is our 1.1.9 project. We made an eggdog which is essential just a picture of a dog that been edited into the shape of an egg.
    <p1> We used a beach wallpaer as our background to make eggdog stand out more on the screen.
    <p1> We first coded so there's an eggdog in the middle serving the purpose of spanwing another eggdog that is controllable.
    <p1> We maded so it can move left or right on command using the left and right arrow button on the keyboard.</p1>
