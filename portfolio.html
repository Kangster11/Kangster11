    <p1> This is our 1.1.9 project. We made an eggdog which is essential just a picture of a dog that been edited into the shape of an egg.
    <p1> We used a beach wallpaer as our background to make eggdog stand out more on the screen.
    <p1> We first coded so there's an eggdog in the middle serving the purpose of spanwing another eggdog that is controllable.
    <p1> We maded so it can move left or right on command using the left and right arrow button on the keyboard.</p1>

    <p1> We designed a game that is similar to the snake game. We replace the replace with a baby duck and replaced apple with variaty of foods. 
    <p1> The goal is to get as many food as possible while not colliding with the wall and the ducks behind it. However, if you do hit the wall 
    <p1> or the ducks behind it the game will reset and the duck will be centered back to the middle of the screen.The backgrounds are all 
    <p1> randowmized and so is the different types of food.
